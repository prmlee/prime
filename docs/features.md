### Note about GraphQL

GraphQL is the foundation of Prime, not an addon.

In Prismic, the biggest downside is typing, most of their fields just output a JSON Scalar. Also their where query interface is not very flexible. Contentful has way better graphql interface, but both of them lack mutations.


# Supported Fields

Included with Prime are these set of core fields

Input/Output: `GraphQLDateTime` or `GraphQLDate` based on the time property.

## Document

Allow the editor to pick another document.

Package: [`@primecms/field-document`](https://github.com/birkir/prime/tree/master/packages/prime-field-document)

      error

    }
  }
}
```


Input:
```json
