Prime is a standalone, self-hosted, headless CMS powered by TypeScript with a GraphQL interface.

## Why Prime?

There are a lot of headless SaaS solutions out there, and most of them better than Prime, but sometimes we need to host the CMS ourselfs but most open source projects are missing some key features that I feel like where Prime can shine.

## Features

- 🧬 Headless GraphQL interface
- 🚀 Simple to use, yet powerful
- 🧱 Slices and groups fields
- ☑️ Create your own custom fields
- 🇮🇸 🇯🇵 Multi language
- 🚧 Preview drafts and releases without publishing
- 🔑 Resource and user access control
- 📆 Plan and schedule releases
- ... and many more
